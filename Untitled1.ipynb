The website contains the data from the EA Sports' game FIFA and gets updated regularly with the release of new versions of the game. data developed by Electronic Arts for the latest edition of their FIFA game franchise. Through several research projects done on soccer analytics, it has been established in the field of acedimia that the use of data from the FIFA franchise has several merits that traditional datasets based on historical data do not offer.

Observe that it seems to be unfeasible to accurately characterize players in these attributes automatically. Thus, all of those are gathered and curated by the company whose job is to bring the gameplay closer to reality as possible, hence preserving coherence and representativeness across the dataset.\n",
